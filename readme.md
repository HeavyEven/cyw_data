# Dataset Description

This dataset contains relevant data for wireless localization, including map data and localization error labels. Below are explanations for two significant folders in the dataset:

## map_data

This folder stores a portion of the map data used for training. Map data plays a crucial role in wireless localization tasks, encompassing the topological structure of the environment, terrain information, and other geographical data relevant to location. These map data are utilized for training and performance evaluation of localization algorithms. The map data includes various types of geographic information, with specific contents dependent on the dataset's purpose and application scenarios.

## tdoa_localization_error_label

The localization error labels stored in this folder are vital for optimizing the accuracy of traditional TDOA-based localization methods. In wireless localization tasks, precise location estimation is crucial. These error labels record the associated error information for each location estimate, typically in the form of distance and angle errors, used as a label for deep learning model training.
